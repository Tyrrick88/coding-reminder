# Coding Reminder Script

This Python script provides a simple reminder to start coding at exactly 7:00 AM. It displays a notification through the command line using the `plyer` library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required library installed:

```bash

pip install plyer
```

## Usage

1. Run eminder_script.pythe script:

```bash
python codeReminder_script.py
```

2. The script will continuously check the current time and display a reminder notification when it's 7:00 AM.

## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
python codeReminder_script.py
```

This will ensure that the `remind_to_code` function works as expected.
